# NodeJS Basics

This repository is intended to store the exercises completed in the NodeJS Fundamentals course.

The directories separate the various modules covered.

### Execution
If you are interested in executing some exercises which have dependencies (this is the case of those that have the 'package.json' file in the directory), being in said directory you must execute the `npm install` command.
